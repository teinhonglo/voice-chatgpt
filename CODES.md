## **Code Flow in Text Version**

### **Text Input Flow**:

```
1. User inputs text message.
2. The `run_text_prompt()` function is called:
   - a. `Chat.prompt()` is invoked to send the user prompt to GPT.
   - b. The GPT model generates a response.
   - c. The response is added to the chat history.
3. `ChatTS.prompt()` is called to simplify the chatbot's response according to a CEFR level (such as A1).
4. `TTS.synthesis()` is called to generate audio for the chatbot's response.
5. If the number of rounds exceeds 10, the conversation ends, and the updated chat history and generated audio are returned.
6. If the user presses the "Saved" button, `save_chat_history()` is called:
   - a. The chat history is saved in JSON and Excel formats.
```

### **Audio Input Flow**:

```
1. User inputs audio message.
2. The `run_audio_prompt()` function is called:
   - a. The audio is transcribed into text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
   - b. The transcribed text is extracted.
3. The transcribed text is passed to `run_text_prompt()`:
   - a. `Chat.prompt()` is invoked to send the transcribed prompt to GPT.
   - b. The GPT model generates a response.
   - c. The response is added to the chat history.
4. `ChatTS.prompt()` is called to simplify the chatbot's response according to a CEFR level (such as A1).
5. `TTS.synthesis()` is called to generate audio for the chatbot's response.
6. If the number of rounds exceeds 10, the conversation ends, and the updated chat history and generated audio are returned.
7. If the user presses the "Saved" button, `save_chat_history()` is called:
   - a. The chat history is saved in JSON and Excel formats.
```

## Code Details

### Classes

#### 1. `Chat`
- **Purpose**: This class initializes and handles interactions with the GPT-based chatbot, allowing the user to send prompts and receive responses.
- **Attributes**:
  - `init_prompt`: A prompt used to set the initial context for the conversation (optional).
  - `llm`: The language model to use (default is `"gpt-3.5-turbo"`).
  - `rubric_reply`: Additional instructions or rubrics for the chatbot's replies (optional).
  - `messages`: A list of all the messages exchanged with the chatbot during the session.
  - `client`: An instance of OpenAI's API client.
  
- **Methods**:
  - `prompt(content, temperature)`: Sends a user prompt to the GPT model, appends the response to the message history, and returns the generated response.
  
#### 2. `ChatTS`
- **Purpose**: Similar to the `Chat` class, this class is specifically used for handling text simplification tasks.
- **Attributes**:
  - Same as the `Chat` class (with `llm` defaulting to `"gpt-3.5-turbo"`).

- **Methods**:
  - `prompt(content, temperature)`: Sends a prompt to the model to simplify the text and returns the simplified version. The last response is removed to ensure the simplification occurs on a clean slate.

#### 3. `TTS`
- **Purpose**: This class handles the text-to-speech (TTS) functionality, converting chatbot responses into audio.
- **Attributes**:
  - `voice`: The voice model used for speech synthesis (default is `"alloy"`).
  - `model`: The TTS model to use (default is `"tts-1-hd"`).
  - `speed`: Adjusts the speaking speed (default is `"1.0"`).
  - `client`: An instance of OpenAI's API client.

- **Methods**:
  - `synthesis(text, speed)`: Converts the provided text into speech and saves the output as an audio file.

### Functions

#### 1. `setup_prompt(chat_history, user_id, init_prompt, grade_prompt, ts_prompt, rubric_prompt, llm, tts_mdl, tts_spk, tts_speed)`
- **Purpose**: Initializes the chatbot and TTS instances for a specific user. It also sends a warm-up message to the chatbot.
- **Parameters**:
  - `chat_history`: Stores the dialogue history.
  - `user_id`: Unique ID for each user.
  - `init_prompt`, `grade_prompt`, `ts_prompt`, `rubric_prompt`: Various prompts used to set up the conversation context.
  - `llm`, `tts_mdl`, `tts_spk`, `tts_speed`: Model and speed configuration for TTS.
  
- **Returns**: Updated chat history and the path to the synthesized audio file.

#### 2. `run_text_prompt(message, chat_history, user_id, tts_speed)`
- **Purpose**: Handles text-based input from the user, generating responses from both the GPT chatbot and text simplification system. It also triggers TTS synthesis.
- **Parameters**:
  - `message`: The user's input message.
  - `chat_history`: Conversation history.
  - `user_id`: Unique user identifier.
  - `tts_speed`: Speed of the synthesized speech.

- **Returns**: Empty string (reset message input box), updated chat history, and the path to the synthesized audio.

#### 3. `run_audio_prompt(audio, chat_history, user_id, tts_speed)`
- **Purpose**: Handles audio input from the user by transcribing the speech into text using OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model and then passing the transcribed text to the chatbot.
- **Parameters**:
  - `audio`: Audio input file.
  - `chat_history`: Conversation history.
  - `user_id`: Unique user identifier.
  - `tts_speed`: Speed of the synthesized speech.

- **Returns**: Updated chat history and the path to the synthesized audio.

#### 4. `save_chat_history(user_id, chat_history, saved_fname, init_prompt, grade_prompt, ts_prompt, rubric_prompt)`
- **Purpose**: Saves the conversation history into JSON and Excel formats. It logs the user inputs, chatbot responses, grammar suggestions, and text simplifications.
- **Parameters**:
  - `user_id`: Unique identifier for the user.
  - `chat_history`: The conversation history to be saved.
  - `saved_fname`: Filename to save the history under.
  - `init_prompt`, `grade_prompt`, `ts_prompt`, `rubric_prompt`: Prompts used for initializing and guiding the conversation.

- **Returns**: None (saves files directly to disk).
